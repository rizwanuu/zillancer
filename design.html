                    <p>At Zillancer, we believe there is a better way to do freelancing. A more valuable,
                        less invasive way where clients can grow their business and save their costs. We are
                        obsessively passionate about it, and our main idea is to build a strong and highly
                        experienced community of freelancers and a thriving remote culture. We help
                        businesses to get their work done at the most competitive price in a specific period
                        offering a hassle-free payment and receiving method for both clients and
                        freelancers.</p>
                    <p>Zillancer is the first freelancing platform in the middle east focusing on ERP and
                        business management solutions. These categories are one of the least understood,
                        exposed and full of complexity in the freelancing world. Many companies – large,
                        medium and small – face challenges while finding the right solution to fit their
                        business requirements. We see that as an opportunity: We are excited to simplify
                        software solutions and digital services for everyone through our community. </p>
